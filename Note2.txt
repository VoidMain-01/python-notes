In Python everything is class
Object is used to represent any class

How to make object in C++
class_name object_name;

How to make object in java
class_name object_name = new class_name;

How to make object in python
object_name = class_name()

How to write python code (way to write python code)
===================================================
In general we can write python code in two ways :
	-> Script Mode (Shell / IDLE)
	-> Interactive Mode
	
	
Interactive Mode :
==================
In this mode we can test any code but not save that code, all code execute line by line.
>>>

Script mode :
=============
In this mode we can save that code by using .py ones we save then we can reuse / edit that code.

ch.1 Opearators
===============
	Expression : collection of both opearator & operand
	
	Opearators :
	
	Operand : may be variable or constant
	
	Keyword : all reserved word / predefine word is called as keyword.
	How to get list of all keyword
>>> import keyword
>>> print (keyword . kwlist )
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Types of Operators using operands :
===================================
- Unary -> work with one operand
		ex : + , - , not , ~
- Binary -> work with two operands
		ex : + , - , * , / , %
-Ternary -> python doesn't support ternary operators
		 -> it support conditional statement that used for lambda function
		 
Syntax : True value if condition else False value 

Types of Operators using opration :
===================================
- Arithmetic -> +, -, *, **, /, //, %
- Relational -> >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
- Bitwise -> &, |, ^, ~, >>, <<
- Conditional
- Logical -> and, or, not
- Assignment -> =
& Comp Assignment -> +=, -=, *=, **=, /=, //=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=

- membership : in , not in
- identity : is, is not
- slicing : regular,  extended

In python everything is known as class.
Object is used to represent class.
Object is used to access both attribute & behaviour of class

Syntax to make object in C++ :
		classname objectname ;
Syntax to make object in java :
		classname objectname = new classname() ;
Syntax to make object in py :
		objectname = classname ()
		
Iterable and not iterable
=========================
from an object we get a single element / works iter function then called as iterable otherwise not iterable object
list (), tuple (), set (), bytes (), bytearray (), dict (), str(), range () are iterable class
but 
int (), float (), complex (), None, bool (), are not iterable class


Mutable & immutable
===================
after create if any object is update / modify then that object is called mutable type other wise called as immutable type.
int (), float (), complex (), None, bool (), tuple (), bytes (), frozenset (), str () are immutable type where as list (), set (), bytearray (), dict (), range (), are mutable type.
